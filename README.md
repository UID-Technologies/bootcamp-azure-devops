Below is a **clean, instructor-ready agenda** that reshapes your revised course into

## **6 Sessions × 2 Hours = 12 Hours (Instructor-led Core)**

with the **remaining ~4 hours** covered via **labs + capstone continuation** (self-paced / guided).

This format works well for **corporate training, LMS scheduling, and calendar planning**.

**Outcome:**
Participants can **secure, monitor, and troubleshoot pipelines confidently**.

---

## **Session 6 (2 Hours): Capstone – End-to-End CI/CD Pipeline**

**Focus:** Apply everything in a realistic delivery scenario

### Capstone Scope

Build a **production-style multi-stage CI/CD pipeline** that includes:

* Source → Build → Package → Deploy stages
* Artifact publishing and consumption
* Environment approvals
* Secure variables and secrets
* Observability and logs

### Activities

* Capstone walkthrough & expectations
* Pipeline design discussion
* Guided implementation
* Validation checklist review
* Demo & feedback

### Deliverables

* Final multi-stage YAML pipeline
* Artifacts produced by pipeline
* Evidence of pipeline runs
* Short README explaining pipeline flow

**Outcome:**
Participants demonstrate **end-to-end CI/CD capability using Azure DevOps**.

---

## **Overall Competencies Built**

By the end of all 6 sessions, participants can:

* Design CI/CD pipelines using Azure DevOps
* Write clean, maintainable YAML pipelines
* Implement multi-stage deployments
* Secure pipelines and manage access
* Optimize and troubleshoot pipelines
* Deliver a real-world CI/CD solution

---

## **Optional Next Steps (If You Want)**

I can also:

* Create **step-by-step labs for each session**
* Design a **formal capstone evaluation rubric**
* Map content to **AZ-400 (DevOps Engineer Expert)**
* Convert this into a **trainer guide + student workbook**
* Create **sample GitHub / Azure DevOps repos**
